## The Wishlist Tracker System

# Project Overview
This is a personal project built in Python to solve a problem that many online shoppers face: financial fragmentation.

Instead of having 50 different tabs open across Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, or losing track of what you can actually afford, this program helps you centralize your purchasing plans. It tracks your items, prioritizes your needs, and actively monitors your budget limits. It turns impulsive 'wants' into calculated financial decisions.

# Why I Built This (My Story)
I am someone who constantly struggles with managing money online. I have spent years filling up shopping carts on different websites, only to either forget what I really needed or accidentally overspend on things I didn't need.

To give you an idea of how weird/chaotic my digital shopping habits were:
* I would have headphones saved in an Amazon cart, shoes on Myntra, and a bool on flipkart,never seeing the total cost in one place.
* I often bought "low priority" items (like gaming skins) and realized too late that I didn't have enough left for "high priority" items (like textbooks).
* I never knew exactly how much spending money I had left until my bank balance hit zero.

I realized I wasn't lacking money but I was lacking organization. I needed a way to objectively look at everything I wanted to buy and see if it actually fit my budget,rather than just guessing. That is why I built this tool.

## Features
* Smart Inventory: Input items with specific details (Price, Website, Priority) to keep everything organized.
* Budget Sentinel: A smart analysis tool that calculates what percentage of your budget is used and triggers warnings or alerts if you get too close to your limit.
* Priority Filtering: Instantly filters your list to show only "High," "Medium," or "Low" priority items so you focus on essentials first.
* Financial Summary: Automatically calculates your total "Pending" costs versus what you have already purchased.
* Lifecycle Tracking: Update items from 'pending' to 'purchased' without deleting them, keeping a record of your spending history.
